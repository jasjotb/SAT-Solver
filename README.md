The implementation assumes that input is given in an "input.cnf" file and displays the result on the console.

Please make sure the custom test cases are stored in the same directory as the source code and the file is named as mentioned above.

We have stored all the sample test cases in a folder named "tests".

These are named as follows:
1. testcase1.cnf
2. testcase2.cnf
3. testcase3.cnf
4. testcase4.cnf
5. testcase5.cnf
